    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity, meaning it can solve the problem quickly even for large inputs.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is often denoted by O(n), where n represents the size of the input. Managing space complexity is crucial, especially in environments with limited memory resources. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a key consideration in designing algorithms.</p>
